# Three-Men-Morris

Three Men's Morris is a strategic symmetric two-player board game played on a three by three point grid (node). 
Each player has three pieces. All the pieces have same movement i.e. each piece can move straight to adjacent node only.
A player can move one piece at a time, and next player moves his/her piece. Each player must block next player from 
making his/her dice in a line and aim to make his/her piece in a line. The line can be vertical, or horizontal. The winner 
is the first player to align their three pieces on a line drawn on the board. The board is empty to begin the game and players
take turns placing their pieces on empty intersections. Once all pieces are placed (assuming there is no winner by then), play 
proceeds with each player moving one of their pieces per turn. A piece may move only to any adjacent empty position. A player
wins if thereby they get three pieces in a line.
